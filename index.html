    <h2>Who is Chris?</h2>
    <p>SyncOnSet was born out of a simple idea: replace the three-ring production binder with professional software designed for how production teams work.</p>
    <p>Now embraced by thousands of TV series and films around the world, SyncOnSet has grown into the leading entertainment technology company for digitizing physical production and managing creative content.</p>

    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>Be fanatical about building software that helps production crews work together faster and happier.</p>
    <p>Whether itâ€™s our award-winning SyncOnSet Production App for managing continuity, our Shop platform for organizing costume team online purchasing, or our Inventory Management System for tracking assets, we build our software with the goal of making it easier and faster for production teams to do their jobs well.</p>
