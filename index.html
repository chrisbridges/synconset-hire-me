    <h2>Who is Chris?</h2>
    <p>SyncOnSet was born out of a simple idea: replace the three-ring production binder with professional software designed for how production teams work.</p>
    <p>Now embraced by thousands of TV series and films around the world, SyncOnSet has grown into the leading entertainment technology company for digitizing physical production and managing creative content.</p>
